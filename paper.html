    <h1>Myrtle beach, South Carolina</h1>
    <p>I like the whole state of South Carolina, but out of all the places, Myrtle Beach is my favorite. Myrtle Beach is my favorite place because the beach is the best. The sunbathing is relaxing and I like going into the ocean. The last time I was there, I was 13 years old. I can still remember how much fun I had and I can't wait to go back again. The boardwalk is a fun place to visit when you go to the beach. It has good food, clothes, and a great view of the beach. Broadway at the Beach is a must see when Myrtle Beach. It's like the boardwalk, but theres more things to do there, and its more popular for people my age. The shops there are always busy and it is right next to the baseball stadium for the minor legue team, The Pelicans.</p>
